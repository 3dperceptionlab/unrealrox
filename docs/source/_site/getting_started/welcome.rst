What is UnrealROX?
==================

UnrealROX is an extremely photorealistic virtual reality environment built over Unreal Engine 4 and designed for generating synthetic data for various robotic vision tasks. This virtual reality environment enables robotic vision researchers to generate realistic and visually plausible data with full ground truth for a wide variety of problems such as class and instance semantic segmentation, object detection, depth estimation, visual grasping, navigation, and more. 


Our motivation
==============

We aim to provide a large-scale photorealistic dataset leveraging hyperrealistic indoor scenes that are explored by a robot agent which also interact with objects in a visually realistic manner. Bla bla...


Our contribution
================

In contrast with state-of-the art approaches/ with current datasets....
