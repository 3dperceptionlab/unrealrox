After checking :ref:`requirements` you can proceed with the installation of UnrealROX. You will only need to clone or download `UnrealROX github`_ and that's all. UnrealROX is a UE4 project you can easily compile with Visual Studio. Before the compilation make sure UnrealROX is selected in Visual Studio as *entry point* in order to avoid compiling the engine! Also you should run the project in *Development Editor* mode to achieve a good performance.
