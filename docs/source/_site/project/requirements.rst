First of all and before installation, you will need to statisfy some hardware and software prerequisites:

1. **Software**:

	1.1 **Unreal Engine 4.18**. You will need to download and install `Unreal Engine`_ 4.18. To access UE4 download you need to firstly create an Epic Games account. Note that UnrealROX was developed using Unreal Engine 4.18, so maybe wouldn't work properly with other UE versions.

	1.2 **VR software**. You have to install either the Oculus or HTC Vive Pro software, or both.
		1.2.1 **Oculus SDK**. Download and install `Oculus SDK for Windows`_. Oculus SDK version used for the development of UnrealROX was 1.30.0 and published on 08/10/2018. 
		1.2.2 **HTC Vive Pro SDK**. Download and install `Vive Software`_. 

	1.3 **Visual Studio**. In order to compile UnrealROX you will need Visual Studio. We recommend to launch Unreal Engine from Visual Studio selecting *robotrix* as starting point (important to avoid compiling the entire engine) and compiling the project in *Development editor* mode for a better performance.  


2. **Hardware**:

	2.1. **GPU**. Make sure your GPU driver is well installed and updated. You need a good GPU to run smoothly a photorealistic scene alongside UnrealROX system. We used a Titan X GPU.

	2.2 **Overall hardware requirements**. For a smooth experience in photorealistic virtual environments rendered by Unreal Engine we recommend a good performance hardware configuration. 

	2.3 **VR headset**. Check if Oculus VR and/or HTC Vive PRO perform properly and if their installation and calibration was done correctly to achieve a good tracking.

3. **You are now ready to install UnrealROX, import your photorrealistic scene and create your own awesome dataset!**
