In the following figure we can see the directory structure of UnrealROX:

    Figure 1. UnrealROX project directory tree.


- **docs** folder contains all the UnrealROX documentation generated with Sphinx.

- **Config** folder contains main configuration files for setting values that control engine behavior. Values set in the game project Config files override the values set in the Engine/Config directory. Config files are generated by default when creating a blank UE4 project.

- **Content** folder contains content for the engine or game including asset packages and maps. Here you can find subfolders such as:

	- **Mannequin** which contains UE4 mannequin's annimation, material, meshes and texture assets.

	- **Maps** which contains a basic scene where you can graps objects with basic geometries and test robot's behaviour. Here you should migrate your photorrealistic scene!

- **Plugins** folder contains plugins used in the engine.

- **Source** folder contains source files with the all project's implementation. Code is structured in:	

	- **TODO**

- **RecordedSequences** folder which contain the sequences you have recorded which are stored in *.txt* files.

- **GeneratedSequences** folder which contain the ground truth generated for the recorded sequences. In Figure 2 we can see the directory structure of the generated data. At the root (*vienese_001*) we have the sequence name which is composed by the *scene name* (e.g. vienese) and the number of sequence (e.g. 001 because it is the first sequence). Then we create a folder for each data modality, in which we store the frames organized in directories for each one of the cameras.
