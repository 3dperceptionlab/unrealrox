Recording
*********


With Oculus VR 
##############

During the recording process all scene information such as, camera location, its configuration and objects pose and orientation, among others, are dumped in a *.txt* file which is stored by default on the *RecordedSequences* folder located in the root of the UnrealROX project. Before recording you need to check the following:

- **HMD location**. You need to check if your HMD and its attached camera are in the correct position. This is variable according to user's height, so, you need to manually configure your main camera position (the main camera is what you see on your Oculus headset). For the configuration you need to press left joystick. Then you will be able to change camera position along Z axis using right joystick and also camera translation on X and Y axes with the left joystick. A good tip for adjusting camera position is checking if shoulders position is corresponding with user's real shoulder position. User's should also be able to see its chest by looking down.


To begin/stop recording, user need to press *A button* from the right Oculus VR controller. A red collored message will appear both on the screen and HMD when recording a sequence. Once recording process is stopped, a *scene.txt* file will be created with all scene information. For more information and a more detailed configuration check *ROXTracker* objectAt the same time, when restarting the scene by pressing *Y button* from the left Oculus Touch...

With the above instructions you will be able to record your own dataset!
